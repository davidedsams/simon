# Simon Slams

A game app for players who want to play Simon online. It's exactly like the popular game in real life except that players also get to enjoy commentary by Simon Cowell as they play. The computer starts the game by pressing a square on the board and the player has to match the square in turn. The game quickly turns from easy to challenging as the pattern of squares pressed increases by one each time a turn is completed and the player has to remember an increasingly complex pattern. The game ends whenever the player fails to match the pattern of the computer or the player matches 8 squares in a row.

## User Stories

#### Bronze Level Goals (These goals are all working on the current version.)

- As a player, I would like the rules and instructions to be easy to find on the page so that I know how to play the game and therefore enjoy it more.
- As a player, I would like to be able to easily see which buttons on the board are being pressed by either the computer or myself so that I can remember the pattern better and get to higher levels.
- As a player, I would like all the buttons to be big enough and far enough apart so that I don't accidentally press the wrong one during game play.
- As a player who requires assistive technologies, I would like accessibility features so that I'm not left out of enjoying the game.

#### Silver Level Goals (These goals and the rest of the levels will be coming soon.)

- As a player, I would like to hear an audible sound just like in the real game when either the computer or myself presses a button so that I can remember the pattern more easily and also enter it in more accurately. And it's just so much more fun with sound too!
- As a player, I would like a button on the board to replay the last pattern in case I want to hear it again before I attempt to match it.
- As a player, I would like the option to change the speed at which the computer plays the pattern so that I can learn to play the game better and have a fun time.
- As a player, I would like the option to turn the sound off so that I can play the game silently on my device and not have to worry about muting my phone or computer completely.
- As a player, I would like the appearance of the game to switch from the pocket version on small and medium size screens to the classic bigger version for desktop screens. This will make my experience on any screen size more enjoyable.

#### Gold Level Goals

- As a player, I would like a video of Simon Cowell to pop up in the corner at intervals throughout the game saying different things depending on my progress or lack thereof. If I win three times in a row I would like a video of Mr. Cowell being brought to tears at how well I just played the game. This will make me want to play the game more often.

#### Platinum Level Goals

- As a player, if I win the game, I would like there to be some sort of dramatic lighting and music effects in the style of a game show to make the game much more fun.

		<h1>How To Play Simon Slams</h1>

		Object of Game: Correctly repeat longer and longer sequences of signals.

		<h3>1-Player Game</h3>

		<ol>
			<li>Press the start button.</li>
			<li>
				Simon will give the first signal. Repeat the signal by pressing the same
				color square.

				signals by pressing the same color squares, in order.
			</li>
			<li>Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one.</li>
			<li>
				Continue playing as long as you can repeat each sequence of signals
				correctly.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly Simon responds with an insult
				and the game ends.

		</ol>

		<h4>How To Win</h4>
